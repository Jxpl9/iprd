# IPRD (Internet Protocol RaDios)
Listen to your favorite radios in one single place.

# How radios are listed

- If only one iteration of the radio exists (ex: local radio), they'll be available in country.m3u
- If multiple iterations of the radio exists (ex: conglomerate or radio group), they'll be available in country_group.m3u

# How to contribute

Contributions are always welcome.

To do so, please create an issue containing the radio you would like to add. 
Carefully read the required points as they'll help us target the appropriate playlist for your stream.

The higher the radio quality is, the better the sound experience will be (lossless > compressed).

# Future plans

- [ ] Properly identify the radios and their groups, for easier maintenance.
- [ ] Scripts to create "one" playlist (can be enhanced over further discussions) containing all the radios.
- [ ] Radio database.
