## Current state of IPRD

Work in Progress (2025-03-24)

## Usage

1. Choose a playlist from the repository (by country or group)
2. Open it with your favorite media player that supports M3U playlists (VLC, Winamp, etc.)
3. Enjoy your radio stations!

## Playlist Organization

Our radio station playlists follow this organization:

- **country.m3u** - Contains standalone radio stations from a specific country
- **country_group.m3u** - Contains radio stations that belong to a broadcasting group/conglomerate

## How to Contribute

Contributions are always welcome! To add a new radio station:

1. Create an issue with the radio station you would like to add
2. Include the following information:
    - Station name
    - Stream URL (direct stream link preferred)
    - Country
    - Broadcasting group (if applicable)
    - Stream quality information

The higher the radio quality, the better the listening experience will be (lossless > compressed).

## Technical Details

- All playlists are in standard M3U format
- Stream URLs should be direct links to media streams
- We prioritize higher quality streams when multiple options exist

## Future Plans

- [ ] Properly identify the radios and their groups for easier maintenance
- [ ] Create scripts to generate comprehensive playlists containing all stations
- [ ] Develop a searchable radio station database
- [ ] Add genre categorization
- [ ] Implement regular link validation to ensure all streams remain active
