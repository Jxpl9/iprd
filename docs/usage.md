   - [Winamp](https://www.winamp.com/) (Windows)
   - [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/) (macOS, Windows)
   - [AIMP](https://www.aimp.ru/) (Windows)
   - [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/) (Windows)

3. **Choose a Station** - Navigate through the list to find a station you're interested in
4. **Playback** - Double-click on the station to start listening

### On Mobile Devices

## Using IPRD Data in Your Applications

If you're a developer and want to integrate IPRD data into your own application:

1. **Access the API** - Check our [API documentation](./api.md) for all technical details
2. **Download JSON Data** - Use our complete catalog to import stations into your application
3. **Respect the License** - Make sure to include proper attribution according to our license terms

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Streams Not Playing

If you're experiencing issues with certain streams:

1. **Check your internet connection** - Streaming requires a stable connection
2. **Try another station** - Some streams may be temporarily offline
3. **Check codecs** - Make sure your player has the necessary codecs for the formats used
4. **Update your player** - Use the latest version of your media player

### Performance Issues

For optimal listening:

1. **Choose appropriate bitrate** - If you have a slow connection, opt for lower bitrate streams
2. **Close other applications** - Reduce load on your device and connection
3. **Use a lightweight player** - Some players are more efficient than others on older devices

## Advanced Usage Tips

- **Create favorites** - Most media players allow you to save your preferred stations
- **Schedule listening** - Use your media player's recording features to schedule recordings of specific shows
- **Use filters** - For large playlists, use your player's search and filtering functions to more easily find stations by genre or country
